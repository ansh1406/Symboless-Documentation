            <h3>Introduction</h3><br>
            <span>Hello {developer.name} here!!!! Hope You're doing fine.</span><br>
            <span>So let's get to the point. Symboless is a lightweight scripting language developed wwith <u>c++</u>
                with no real world use case
                yup you heard it right it dosen't have any use.</span><br>
            <span>Huh! So why I made it well just for cracking SHA-256 I've developed it to crack secure hash algorithms
                so that I can steal some of that juicy cryptocurrency out of your pockets (or maybe digital wallets).
                Hope someone was not smart enough to actually believe it. Enough "Khayali pulaw" so to tell you the
                truth it was developed just cuz I wanted to have some fun in my boring semester end break but I'd
                definitely say the process of developing Symboless has really taught me many things about various
                topics. (Yes it didn't teach me anything but you know I have to say it to make me look more
                responsible).</span><br>
            <span>So just do not take it seriously and skim through it (only if you want to) and maybe write one or two
                programs and mail me so I can have some pride in it and acquire a little bit of happiness in my boring
                single life.</span><br>
            <span>Let's end this absolutely worthless talk and move on to the actual topic.</span><br>

            <a name="installation_guide"></a>
            <h3>Installation Guide</h3><br>

            <span>To get started with Symboless just like any other language you'll have to install it on your computed
                I'll leave the files somewhere in the footer (Cause I've already designed the header and I definitely
                don't want to mess with it. I hate desigining why can't we use curl. *cry emoji* *cry emoli*)</span><br>

            <span>Just download those files (They'll probabaly be in .zip format) and refer to the Installation guide
                provided in the next topic.</span>

            <span>And yes it's free and open source even though it's the result of decades of my pure dedication and
                hardwork I'm providing the application for free and open source you can use it for making money if you
                can (and maybe share some of it with me too)</span><br>

            <span>I'll leave the link of github repo somewhere in the footer too.</span><br>
            <span>You can follow below steps to install Symboless:</span><br>

            <span>1- Download the Installation zip file and extract it. </span><br>
            <span>2- Compile the <u>symls.cpp</u> file while including the path of dependencies folder in your linker
                paths.</span><br>
            <span>3- And voila! there you have it.</span><br>
            <span>4- Symboless also comes with <u>symlsConfig.json</u> file you can configure I/O files, keywords,
                operators etc.</span><br>
            <span>5- <u>symlsConfig.json</u> should be included in the folder you'll store your Symobless files
                otherwise it'll operate with default values.</span><br>


            <a name="getting_started"></a>
            <h3>Getting Started</h3><br>
            <span>Symboless as you would've guessed is a complete CLI based application (I don't heve guts to develope a
                UI. Even if I tried I'd most likely make it worse than CLI version).</span><br>

            <span>So to get started open your cmd/powershell/bash whatever you have.</span><br>
            <span>type the name of application you got after compiling <u>symls.cpp</u> and press enter.</span><br>

            <span>Now you are currently running Symboless and can give any command and get out of it by giving
                &quot;end&quot; command.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>shell</lable>
                <span>> symls &#9166;</span><br>
                <span>print &quot;Hello World!&quot; &#9166;</span><br>
                <span>Hello World!</span><br>
                <span>end &#9166;</span><br>
                <span>></span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Or you can save your script in a seperate file with <u>.symls</u> extension and provide it's name to
                the application by command line arguments.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>shell</lable>
                <span>> symls file.symls &#9166;</span><br>
                <span>Hello World!</span><br>
                <span>></span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>And voila! you just executed your first Symboless script.</span>

            <a name="syntax"></a>
            <h3>Syntax</h3><br>
            <span>Syntax of Symboless consists of individual expressions (Ofcourse it's just my terminology you call
                them whatever you want) seperated by line breaks or <u>and </u> keyword. So you can do something
                like-</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>syntax.symls</lable>
                <span>print "Hello "</span><br>
                <span>print "World!"</span><br>
                <span>end</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>or</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>syntax.symls</lable>
                <span>print "Hello " and print "World!"</span><br>
                <span>end</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Both of them will produce same outcome.</span><br>

            <span>And this chaining can be indefinitely long (Well it'll crash if the line got longer than maximum size
                of c++ string container).</span><br>

            <span>You can end the program with <u>end</u> keyword as stated in the examples.</span><br>

            <a name="variables"></a>
            <h3>Variables</h3><br>

            <span>Yes!!! We have variables well I can't even imagine a programming language without the feature of
                variables. And as you've already guessed they can store a single value of certain data type and can
                change value throughout the program any number of times. In Symboless you can declare variables let
                keyword followed by data type of variable followed by name of variable. </span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>variable.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer number</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>You can also initialize the variable with some initial value while declaring it.</span><br>

            <span>In Symboless variable name can only consist 0-9, A-Z and a-z (No underscore) and it can not start with
                a number.</span>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>variable.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer number is 30</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Variables can be of any three data type which Symboless support (Details in next section).</span><br>

            <span>You can change thier value by assigining them with a new value like this.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>variable.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer number is 30</span><br>
                <span>number is 50</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>In symboless variables don't have something luxurious like scope or life so to sum it up every
                variable is global no matter where it's declared in main program, in subroutine, inside a if statements,
                inside a loop anywhere every variable is global and can be accessed from anywhere in the program
                throughout the whole execution.</span>

            <a name="data_types"></a>
            <h3>Data Types</h3><br>

            <span>Symboless supports three data types:</span><br>
            <span>1- Integer</span><br>
            <span>2- Text</span><br>
            <span>3- Real</span><br>

            <span>Integer can store positive and negative integers and zero.</span><br>

            <span>Text can store any string of characters.</span><br>

            <span>Real can store floating point numbers.</span><br>

            <span>You can initialize and assign them values like this.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>data_types.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer number is 30</span><br>
                <span>let text name is "Symboless"</span><br>
                <span>let real pi is 3.14</span><br>
                <span>number is 50</span><br>
                <span>name is "Hello"</span><br>
                <span>pi is 6.28</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <a name="arrays"></a>
            <h3>Arrays</h3><br>

            <span>I won't bore with you what arrays are here's the syntax to declare them.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>arrays.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer-array numbers-5</span><br>
                <span>let integer-array n2</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>You can choose to specify their size like first line otherwise Symboless will declare them with a
                default size which is <u>64</u> by default and can be changed using <u>symlsConfig.json</u>
                file.</span><br>

            <span>You can access elements of an array like this.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>arrays.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer-array numbers-5</span><br>
                <span>numbers-3 is 10</span><br>
                <span>print numbers-3</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>By default every element of- integer array is <u>0</u>, text array is <u>&quot;&quot;</u> and real
                array is <u>0.0</u> and yes this also can be changed in config file.</span><br>

            <a name="input_output"></a>
            <h3>Input Output</h3><br>

            <span>You can take input using <u>read</u> keyword and print the output using <u>print</u>
                keyword.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>input_output.symls</lable>
                <span>let text name</span><br>
                <span>read name</span><br>
                <span>print name</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>You can chain both print and read commands using then keyword.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>input_output.symls</lable>
                <span>let text name</span><br>
                <span>let integer age</span><br>
                <span>read name then age</span><br>
                <span>print "Name: " then name then " Age: " then age then newline</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>You can use <u>newline</u> keyword with print to move to next line (Also customizable using
                configuration file).</span><br>

            <a name="operators"></a>
            <h3>Operators</h3><br>

            <span>There are two types of operators in Symboless Mathamatical and Logical(not you old AND, OR, NOT but
                comparison one's yes I'm calling them logical operator cause they are like they are way more fundamental
                in terms of logic if I say something is equal to something didn't I determine by some logic).
            </span><br>

            <span>And also every single operator in Symboless can be configured via configuration file.</span><br>

            <table class="operator-table">
                <thead>
                    <th>OPERATOR</th>

                        <td>Not equal comparison</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table><br>

            <span>Yes we have modulo function for real numbers too!!!</span><br>

            <span>All of these operators can be used like shown below.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>operators.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a is 10</span><br>

                <span>let integer c</span><br>
                <span>c is a plus b</span><br>
                <span>c is a minus b</span><br>
                <span>c is a into b</span><br>
                <span>c is a upon b</span><br>
                <span>c is a modulo b</span><br>
                <span>c is a exponent b</span><br>
                <span>if a is greater-than b then skip else stop</span><br>
                <span>if a is less-than b then skip else stop</span><br>
                <span>if a is equal-to b then skip else stop</span><br>
                <span>if a is not-equal-to b then skip else stop</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>No no no!!! No need to panic I'll tell more about if, then, else, skip and stop later on in branching
                section just bear with me till then.</span><br>

            <span>There is no operator precedence all operators are equally prioritized and the order of execution is
                right to left meaning <u>10 into 20 plus 5</u> will be equal to <u>250</u> and not <u>205</u>.
            </span><br>

            <span>Logical operators can only be used for conditional statements inside <u>if</u> or <u>while</u>
                expressions.</span><br>

            <span>Mathamatical operators can only be used in conditional statements or in assignment expressions
                (including initialization) you can not do something like.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>operators.symls</lable>
                <span>print a plus b</span><br>
                <span>a is b less-than d</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>The above snippet will throw an error.</span><br>

            <a name="chaining"></a>
            <h3>Chaining</h3><br>

            <span>Since Symboless is an interpreted language it dosen't know what's written after the line it's
                currently executing so if want it to read the next statement beforehand you can chain multiple
                statements together.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>chaining.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a is 10 and let integer b is 20 and let integer c is a plus b</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>You can also give a line break after and keyword Symboless will understand it and treat them as one
                single statement (and you need not to care about indentation since we are not python, our syntax may be
                worse than python but we don't declare your code invalid just because of an extra or less
                space).</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>chaining.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a is 10 and</span><br>
                <span>let integer b is 20 and</span><br>
                <span>let integer c is a plus b</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Chaining is an essential part of Symboless as it make it possible to have multiple statements inside
                <u>if</u> and <u>while</u> statements.</span><br>

            <a name="conditional_statements"></a>
            <h3>Conditional Statements</h3><br>

            <span>Symboless have only one conditional statement <u>if then else stop</u> expression. </span>

            <span>The condition will go between <u>if</u> and <u>then</u> keywords and if the condition is true the
                expression between <u>then</u> and <u>else</u> will execute and in case of false the expression between
                <u>else</u> and <u>stop</u> will execute.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>conditional_statements.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a</span><br>
                <span>let integer b</span><br>
                <span>read a then b</span><br>
                <span>if a is greater-than b then print a else print b stop</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>If you want to execute multiple statements in any case you must chain them with <u>and</u>
                keyword</span><br>

            <span>You can add line breaks after <u>then</u> and <u>else</u> keywords and Symboless will treat them as a
                single expression.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>conditional_statements.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a</span><br>
                <span>let integer b</span><br>
                <span>read a then b</span><br>
                <span>if a is greater-than b then</span><br>
                <span>print a else</span><br>
                <span>print b stop</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Each <u>if</u> must be conjugated with <u>else</u> you can not have any <u>if</u> alone </span><br>

            <span>If you want to do nothing in case of condition is true or false you can use <u>skip</u> keyword after
                <u>then</u> or <u>else</u> respectively or you can even leave it empty (well adding an extra skip will
                make reading the code easier).</span><br>

            <a name="loops"></a>
            <h3>Loops</h3><br>

            <span>Symboless have only one loop the <u>while do till-here</u> loop and well I think all other types of
                loop provided in other languages are just extras while is the only thing you ever need (only if you're a
                good programmer of course).</span><br>

            <span>The condition is provided between <u>while</u> and <u>do</u> keywords and statements are provided
                between <u>do</u> and <u>till-here</u> keywords.</span><br>

            <span>You can use <u>recheck</u> keyword to recheck the condition at any point and restart the loop from the
                beginning (yes it's continue I just didn't wanna use same term).</span><br>

            <span>You can use <u>escape</u> keyword to break out of the loop at any point.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>loops.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a is 0</span><br>
                <span>while a is less-than 10 do</span><br>
                <span>print a then newline and</span><br>
                <span>a is a plus 1 till-here</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Just like after <u>then</u> and <u>else</u> you can also insert line break after <u>do</u>
                keyword.</span><br>

            <span>And just like <u>if</u> you can chain multiple statements inside <u>while</u> statement.</span><br>

            <a name="subroutine"></a>
            <h3>Subroutines</h3><br>

            <span>Subroutines are reusable blocks of code in Symboless you can call any subroutine using <u>goto</u>
                keyword.</span><br>

            <span>In symboless subroutines must be declared only after the main code has ended.</span><br>

            <span>a subroutine starts with <u>subroutine</u> keyword followed by it's name and ends with <u>end</u>
                keyword.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>subroutine.symls</lable>
                <span>goto printHello</span><br>
                <span>end</span><br>
                <span>subroutine printHello</span><br>
                <span>print "Hello World!"</span><br>
                <span>end</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>Since Symboless don't have scopes subroutines can access all variables declared anywhere in the code
                and main code can also access variables declared inside any subroutine that has already been
                called.</span><br>

            <span>You can break out of a subroutine by using <u>esacape</u> keyword.</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>subroutine.symls</lable>
                <span>let integer a is 10</span><br>
                <span>let integer b is 20</span><br>
                <span>goto sum</span><br>
                <span>print "Sum: " then sum</span><br>
                <span>end</span><br><br>
                <span>subroutine sum</span><br>
                <span>integer sum is a plus b</span><br>
                <span>end</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <span>That extra empty line after the ending of main program is just for the asthetics.</span><br>

            <a name="header_file"></a>
            <h3>Header File</h3><br>

            <span>I have also made a c++ class for Symboless which you can access by including the header file provied
                in <u>includes</u> folder in the installation.</span><br>

            <span>It have <u>Symboless</u> class under <u>symboless</u> namespace</span><br>

            <span>The constructor accepts 3 parameter the Symboless code, a string in which all the inputs which'll be
                required while execution are provided and a string in which the output will be returned</span><br>

            <div class="code-block">
                <lable>header_file.cpp</lable>
                <span>#include "symls.hpp"</span><br>
                <span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span><br>
                <span>int main(){</span><br>
                <span>std::string code = "let integer a and read a and let integer b and read b and let integer c is a
                    plus b and print c and end";</span><br>
                <span>std::string inputs = "3\n5";</span><br>
                <span>std::string output = "";</span><br>
                <span>symboless::Symboless s(code, inputs, output);</span><br>
                <span>std::cout &lt;&lt; output &lt;&lt; std::endl;</span><br>
                <span>return 0;</span><br>
                <span>}</span><br>
            </div><br>

            <a name="message_from_developer"></a>
            <h3>Message from developer</h3><br>

            <span>Well that took ages to type hope you didn't tldr (most likely you did). Well that doesn't matter
                believe me or not I really had fun typing all this sitting lonely on a single chair for hours.
            </span><br>

            <span>So what I wanna say is if you have some spare time just install it make one or two little programs or
                maybe play with configurations and send me some screenshots on my email if you want to make my
                day......... peace.</span><br>
